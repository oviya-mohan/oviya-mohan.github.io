I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Brain and Cognitive Sciences](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/bcs/) department at the University of Rochester, New York. I work in the [Collective Cognition Lab](https://collcoglab.bcs.rochester.edu) with [Dr. Dora Biro](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/bcs/people/faculty/biro_dora/index.html) and in the [Marmo Lab](https://marmolab.bcs.rochester.edu/) with [Dr. Jude Mitchell](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/bcs/people/faculty/mitchell_jude/index.html). My primary research interest is in collective decision-making, specifically coordinated problem-solving. I am interested in understanding the cognitive capacities required for complex coordinated problem-solving by exploring them across various species, including humans and marmosets. I also employ eye-tracking methods to better understand social cognition, which in turn facilitates successful coordination. I enjoy taking an interdisciplinary approach to my research and aim to incorporate deep learning and machine vision tools to study collective behavior in naturalistic settings. I am also passionate about outreach and constantly strive to share my enthusiasm for research with a wider audience.
